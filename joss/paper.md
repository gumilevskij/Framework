# Summary

At its core, `Snowdrop` is a robust and versatile Python package designed for the
analysis of macroeconomic *Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium* (*DSGE*) models.
In its entirety, this package offers an extensive framework for the study of various related
economic models, including *New Keynesian* models, *Real Business Cycle* models, *Gap*
models, and *Overlapping Generations* models. `Snowdrop` equips
researchers with essential tools to address the fundamental requirements of
these models, encompassing estimation, simulation, and forecasting processes.
In particular, the package employs robust and efficient solution techniques to
solve both linear and nonlinear perfect foresight models based on the rational
expectations hypothesis, which is a critical need for many *DSGE* models.

# Statement of need

*DSGE* models are a mainstay class of models employed by Central Banks around the
world, informing key country monetary policy decisions.
